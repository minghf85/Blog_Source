# Why manimce not manimgl
## manimce: manim community edition
- With a mature community, we can find a lot of cases for learning and fixing bugs.
- Authors of the community can update the version frequently to fill more usefull function.
- Though there is not a realtime editing and gpu acceleration,I believe the community can develop these function soon.

## manimgl
- The original version maintained by 3Blue1Brown (Grant Sanderson)
- Offers real-time preview functionality (manim editor)
- Includes GPU acceleration for faster rendering
- More limited community support compared to manimce
- Development updates may be less frequent

# Key Differences

| GPU Acceleration | No      | Yes     |
| Realtime Preview | No      | Yes     |
| Documentation    | Extensive | Limited |

# Recommendation
For most users, manimce is recommended due to its active community and frequent updates. However, if you specifically need GPU acceleration or real-time preview, manimgl might be worth considering.
